\section{SYSTEM DESCRIPTION}

In this section we will describe the sensors set up. Here are some notes for myself.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Acquisition from the $11^{th}$ february to the $21^{th}$ march
    \item ULaval Pouliot facing east
    \item Approx angle from -z:
    \item Approx Height =
\end{itemize}

Some notes to fill up the table:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LMS200
        \begin{itemize}
            \item See page 8. Range vs reflectivity
            \item See page 7. It is around 20cm at 20m
            \item Class 1, $\lambda=905 nm$
        \end{itemize}
    \item LMS151
        \begin{itemize}
            \item See page 25. Scanning range up to 50 m (164.04 ft) with $>$ 75\% object remission (18 m (59.06 ft) with 10\% object remission)
            \item See page 26. $distance(mm (in)) * 0.015 rad + 8 mm (0.31 in)$
            \item Class 1, $\lambda=905 nm$
        \end{itemize}
    \item Hokuyo
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 0.1 to 10m : $\pm$30mm,10 to 30m : $\pm$50mm(White Kent Sheet)
            \item See article : Spot size is 50 mm × 500 mm at sensor’s maximum distance of 30 m
            \item See page 6. Up to 3 echoes.
            \item Class 1, $\lambda=905 nm$
        \end{itemize}
    \item Velodyne
        \begin{itemize}
            \item See manual page 12. 1 to 70 meters... Datasheet says 80-100m...
            \item See page 23. The lasers project a well defined rectangular shaped spot that is approximately 4” wide by 2” tall at 100’ distance. The spot size at the source of the HDL-32 is approximately 1/2” wide by 1/4” tall, causing the angular divergence to be 2.79 milliradians.
            \item Class 1, $\lambda=905 nm$
            \item Time of flight
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
