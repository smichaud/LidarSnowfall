\section{EXPERIMENTAL SETUP}
Data acquisition was conducted at Pouliot Pavilion of Laval University beginning February 11 and ending March 21. The sensors were placed close to the inner wall of a window facing N\SI{50}{\degree}E. A wooden structure held the LiDARs side by side at approximately \SI{13.9}{\meter} above the ground and the main scanning plane (i.e. \SI{0}{\degree} in the sensor reference frame) forming a \SI{30}{\degree} angle with respect to the building wall. In this configuration, a slight opening of the window allowed to keep the LiDARs inside while scanning outside. To avoid direct light exposure between sensors, corrugated plastic layers were placed between them. Note that we observed no interference between the sensor readings. Figure~\ref{fig:setup} present an overview of the setup.

Recording of data was made through the Hydro distribution of the Robot Operating System (ROS)~\cite{ROSWeb}, which provide standardized data type as well as time synchronisation. The sicktoolbox\_wrapper~\cite{LMS200Web}, lms1xx~\cite{LMS151Web} and urg\_node~\cite{HokuyoWeb} packages provided LaserScan~\cite{LaserScan} messages for the LMS200, LMS151 and UTM-30LX-EW respectively. The velodyne[todo ref] package produced the PointCloud2[todo ref] messages for the HDL-32E.
