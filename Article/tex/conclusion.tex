\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

A significant side benefit of the more sensitive sensors (LMS-200, Hokuyo UTM-30LX-EW) is that they are capable of recording the temporal evolution of a snowstorm, at a fine-grained level. This is something that is not possible with traditional snow measuring equipment, which can only report accumulation over long period of times. Indeed, for b) we see a pretty steady snowfall from $t=1$ to $t=4$ hours, with a peak around $t=1.25$ hours. This could be helpful in developing temporal models of snowstorms, to be used in a vehicle simulator for example or simply in meteorological studies.

Open question such as how the maximum range is affected by the snow.
